## Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation Project From Udacity

## Predicting Bike-Sharing Data (My First Neural Network)

In this project, I built a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know. 

## Methods and Frameworks utilized

- **NumPy** - a fundamental package for scientific computing in python
- **Pandas** - an ease-to-use python library for manipulating data structures and performing data analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook** - tool that allow the creation of documents with live code
- **Matplotlib** - a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. 

## What you should already know

- neural networks, 
- forward and back-propagation
- gradient descent

## Instruction

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
2. Download the project
3. cd into the project folder
4. Run the code below to create and activate new environment

```
conda create --name deep_learning
```
 - Mac/Linux: 
```
source activate deep_learning 
```
